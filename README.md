In this game, the player is a ball. For the movement, you can use the arrow keys or WASD. The main objective for this game is to reach the longest time. Your time is the score in this game. Once you have finished playing, you can enter in your name into the scoreboard and see where you have placed. If you can't find your name, use the search to the right of the scoreboard and type in your name. You may see your name and time on the scoreboard. If you wish to see the original scoreboard, click on the refresh button below the search next to the scoreboard. If you want to play again, press the Play Again button, if you want to go to the menu screen, press the Menu button. Have fun and try to beat your score/time!
